See https://www.reddit.com/r/RadPowerBikes/comments/txk17k/rr_caboose_tribute_post/ for detail about what this is.

The file backplate.dxf has all the parts on it. You'll see there are 2 versions of the bit that bolts to the frame. I never cut the larger version that uses all 4 bolt holes; The 3 bolt version is plenty strong enough.

Caveats:
- The CAD file assumes 12mm thick material is used. If you use some other thickness the slot widths will need to be modified so the parts interlock.
- I used PolyCarbonate for this. It is complete overkill but it's what i had lying around. A tough plywood might work?
- The mounting holes are in the right place for my RR but i don't know how accurate the manufacture of the RR frame is. Probably worth measuring the spacing between the mounting holes before you cut.
- I made a mistake in the planning phase: The left board interferes with the brake. See the picture: ![board_hits_brake](PXL_20220203_095544610.jpg?raw=true) Rather than cut the part again, i just modified it slightly with hand tools to the board no longer pushes the brake.
